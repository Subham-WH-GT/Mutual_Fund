Overview
This project is a Mutual Fund Scheme Predictor that predicts the best mutual fund schemes based on 
various input parameters like SIP amount, Lumpsum investment, Expense Ratio, Risk Levels, and past performance (1 year, 3 years, 5 years). The model uses machine learning to analyze historical data and recommend suitable mutual fund schemes.

Features
Input financial data such as SIP, Lumpsum, Alpha, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, Risk Level, and Returns for different time periods.
Predict suitable mutual fund schemes using a trained machine learning model.
User-friendly interface to input parameters and get predictions.
